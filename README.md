![Palo Alto Networks Logo](docs/images/paloaltonetworks_logo.png)

A collection of automation demonstrations that I use for work; provides Ansible playbooks, Python scripts, and Terraform projects to automate and manage Palo Alto Networks devices.

This repository is mostly geared towards hands-on workshops where we teach the tecnology, it should not be considered a production-ready solution.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a collection of Ansible playbooks and Docker containers designed to automate and manage Palo Alto Networks devices. The project is structured with standalone Ansible playbooks residing in the "ansible" directory, each in their own subdirectory. The project root contains a `tasks.py` file which works with Invoke to manage Docker containers and run playbooks.

The container image can be built or pulled from the GitHub Container Registry. The container image is based on the official Python Docker image for both x86 and ARM CPU architectures, and includes the Palo Alto Networks Ansible collection and the required Python libraries to execute the playbooks.

## Setting Up Your Environment

There are two ways to set up your environment to execute the Ansible playbooks in this repository. You can either use Invoke to build the Docker containers and access the shell of the containers, or you can create Python virtual environments and execute Ansible within the virtual environments.

### Using VScode Dev Containers

1. clone this repository to your local workstation with VScode installed
2. after installing VScode's "Dev Container's" extension, open the repository in a container with `Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container...`

### Creating Python Virtual Environments

1. Install Python virtualenv: `pip3 install virtualenv`
2. Create a virtual environment: `virtualenv venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - For Linux/Mac: `source venv/bin/activate`
   - For Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
4. Install the required Python libraries: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Where to Find Documentation

Project-specific documentation can be found in the README.md files within each standalone Ansible project directory. For general Ansible documentation, visit the official Ansible website: https://docs.ansible.com/
